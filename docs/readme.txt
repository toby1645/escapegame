Welcome to Escape! A puzzle game that loops each time you die. If you’re in easy mode the room you’re in will simply reset and 
if you’re in hard mode you will loop back to the start of the game. Also, be careful! You may wonder into a room and find an unexpected surprise…


Controls:

Arrow keys: Movement

R: Restart Room

Escape key: Exit to menu


If you become stuck check out the walkthrough.txt file inside the game's folder.


Everything was created in under 48 hours for Ludum Dare 47.


Creator's note: I consider hard mode the real mode for the game.
