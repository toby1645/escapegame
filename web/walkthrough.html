<p>room 1 - Grab the key and then run to the door, the key will get used and you 
can leave.<br />
<br />
room 2 - Be careful approaching the far side of the room, going into that area 
will trigger a surprise spike attack. In order to survive you need to briefly 
inch into the trigger area (which is the entirety of the far right side of the 
room) and then quickly move back to avoid the spikes. Once they are off-screen 
you are safe and can leave the room.<br />
<br />
room 3 - The hint of WSAD revers to the order you should press the buttons in. 
On a keyboard the layout of the WSAD keys, if viewed as arrow keys, will give 
you the code up, down, left, right. Once you trigger all four buttons in that 
order they will turn green and unlock the door.<br />
<br />
room 4 - You need to start running as soon as the room appears. It is possible 
to reach the exit at the bottom, but there is no time<br />
for any delays.<br />
<br />
room 5 - Another button puzzle, this one is a bit more simple. There are four 
buttons, three will kill you upon stepping on them but<br />
one will unlock the door. The correct button is the one in the top right corner.<br />
<br />
room 6 - For this one you kind of have to feel your way around. However the key 
presses go like this: left, down, left, up, right, up.<br />
It's up to you to figure out how long to hold each button for, and if you guess 
wrong then you're in for a nasty surprise!<br />
<br />
room 7 - There are two exits, one will kill you and one won't. You can only use 
the key once per try. Pick up the key and go the left<br />
door, the key will unlock the door and you can leave.<br />
<br />
room 8 - This room seems very bare, however as you walk to the other side of the 
room you will end up triggering three spike attacks. This is similar the spike 
attack from room 2. There are two ways to go about surviving the spikes. First, 
you can use the same method you used for getting through room 2. You inch 
forward enough to trigger the spikes and then step back. Secondly, you can zig 
zag through the room to avoid the spikes. The first one triggers from the 
bottom, so you would need to pass along the top of the room. The second one 
triggers from the top of the room, so you would need to pass along the bottom of 
the room. Finally, The third one triggers from the bottom of the room, so you 
would need to pass along the top of the room.<br />
<br />
Whoo! You completed the game!</p>
